formula = set of clauses

clause =  var1 or var2 or .... or varn

pure literal = variable that appears only 1 time

unit clause = clause of length 1 = clause with only 1 variable

split = choose a variable and choose true/false for this variable

Davis Putnam:
easy cases
	pure literal = make literal true
	unit clause = make variable true
hard case
	split = make the right choice ????? <- strategy
